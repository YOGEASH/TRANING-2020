Carrot

 Tim  | Carrot | 2012-08-18 |     28 

select g.name,p.name,date1,amount from picked pi inner join plant p on pi.plantFk=p.plantid inner join gardener g on  g.gardenerid=pi.gardenerFk where g.name='Tim' and amount>20 order by amount;

Tim|Radish|16-JUL-2012|23
Tim|Carrot|18-AUG-2012|28

9)Find out persons who picked from the same location as he/she planted.

select name from gardener where gardenerid in (select pi.gardenerFk from planted p  inner join picked pi on pi.plantfk=p.plantFk where p.locationFk=pi.locationFk);

Father

Erin

10)Create a view that lists all the plant names picked from all locations except ’West’ in the month of August.

select distinct name from plant inner join picked ON picked.plantFk=plant.plantid where locationFk in (0,1,3) and date1 like '%AUG%';

create view ten as select distinct name from plant inner join picked ON picked.plantFk=plant.plantid where locationFk in (0,1,3) and date1 like '%AUG%';
